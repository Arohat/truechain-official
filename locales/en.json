      "subhead": "TrueChain is the first public chain in the world which brings about the technology of hybrid consensus combining PBFT and POW.",
      "p1": "Many public chains based on single consensus mechanism such as PoW or PoS, are having a bottleneck in efficiency. One the other hand, those based on dPoS or dBFT have been improved in efficiency, but are having problems in decentralization. TrueChain uses hybrid consensus combining PBFT and PoW to solve the biggest problem confronting public blockchain: the contradiction between decentralization and efficiency. TrueChain takes advantage of PBFT which is fast to reach consensus, to provide the high performance needed by value transmission and commercial activities of decentralized applications. Meanwhile, TrueChain uses PoW nodes as validators, and leave the election and oversight of PBFT to the hands of PoW to ensure the whole chain to be decentralized and therefore secure.",
      "p2": "TrueChain adopts sharding to raise the transaction processing speed, to realize scalability without affecting the safety of hybrid consensus. TrueChain integrates fruitchain technology into PoW protocol to allow regular users to participate in mining more fairly, and re-assure complete decentralization.",
      "p3": "True Chain also creates Easy DApp, the easy-to-use developing framework for decentralized applications. Developers can take advantage of Easy DApp and use standard API, with the facilitation of x86 virtual machine, to develop and deploy decentralized applications easily and quickly.",
      "p4": "TrueChain’s complete matrix of products allows users and institutions to interact with the chain conveniently. Included in the product matrix are Stellar -- the toolkit for the DApp developers to create smart contracts and manage the life cycle of the contracts; DApp Store-- the store for decentralized applications on True Chain; TrueScan explorer; True Light Wallet, etc.",
      "p5": "The leading research and engineering team members of True Chain come from the U.S., India and China.",
      "p6": "True Chain is a committee member of China’s National Cloud Industry Strategic Innovation Alliance, a member of the National Chain-Web Innovation Center of China; and is also one of the few block chain projects that have been reported by China’s authoritative media - CCTV, and also participated in the research work of the white paper released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the Chinese government.
